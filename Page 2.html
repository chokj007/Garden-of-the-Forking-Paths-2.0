            Immediately I recollected the <br> 
            spoken in German. It was that <br> 
            Madden. Madden, in Viktor <br> 
            meant the end of all our work <br> 
            seemed a secondary matter, or <br> 
            so to me - of our lives also. <br> 
            meant that Runeberg had been <br> 
            murdered. 1 Before the sun set <br> 
            ran the same risk. Madden was <br> 
            to be more accurate, he was <br> 
            implacable. An Irishman in the <br> 
            a man suspected of equivocal <br> 
            actual treachery, how could he <br> 
            seize upon this extraordinary <br> 
            discovery, capture and perhaps <br> 
            agents of Imperial Germany?
